## Week 3 Code Challenge
## Requirements
    A web browser
    A local web server
    Node.js installed
    Git

## Installation
    Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    Navigate to the project directory using the following command:
    Install the required dependencies using the following command:
    Start the JSON Server using the following command:
    Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

## Features
The system has the following features:
  You can view a list of movies with their title, poster, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.
  You can select a movie from the list to view its details, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.
  Buy a ticket for the selected movie, which updates the ticket count and available tickets on the frontend and server.

## Code Overview
The system is built using JavaScript and interacts with a JSON server to store and retrieve movie data. Here is an overview:

  index.html: The main HTML file that displays the movie list and movie details.
  style.css: The main CSS file that styles the HTML elements.
  script.js: The main JavaScript file that interacts with the JSON server to display, add, update, and delete movie data.
  db.json: It is used to store the movie data in a JSON format.


## Conclusion
Flatdango is a simple example of how JavaScript can interact with a JSON server to build dynamic web applications. With some additional features and improvements, it could be turned into a fully-functional ticket booking system.
